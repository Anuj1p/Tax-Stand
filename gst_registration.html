                        One of the benefits of GST is the elimination of multiple indirect taxes that existed earlier. So many taxes have been replaced. Taxes like excise, octroi, sales tax, Service tax, CENVAT, turnover tax, etc are not applicable anymore and all those have come under common tax called GST.

                        From manufacturing to consumption, GST is applicable at all stages. It is providing tax credit benefits at every stage in the chain. In the earlier scenario, at every stage, the margin used to get added and tax was paid on the whole amount. Under GST the businesses are taking benefit of Input Tax Credit and tax is being paid on the amount of value addition only. GST has reduced the cascading effect of tax thereby reducing the cost of the product.

                        Because GST has reduced the cost of products, the demand, for some – if not all, products have increased. With the increase in demand, to meet the increase in supply, the employment graph has started going up.

                <p>
                    Inputs are all those goods that went into creating the finished products provided to the final consumer. Businesses are charged GST on goods/services that are used as inputs. The ITC mechanism allows GST registered businesses to receive refunds on the GST paid for purchasing all inputs. This helps prevent the cascading taxation effect, which was the primary reason behind the introduction of the GST.
                    <br><br>
                    For instance: GST payable on the supply of the final product of a manufacturer is Rs. 850 and the GST paid on inputs is Rs. 725. The manufacturer can claim the Rs. 725 as ITC. This brings the net tax payable at the time of supply to Rs. 125 only (Rs. 850 – Rs. 725).
                    <br><br>
                    Under the previous indirect tax regime of levy of Service Tax, VAT, and Excise – a lot of input tax credit was not properly utilized.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Who are eligible to claim Input Tax Credit?</h3>
                    
                    ITC is available only to those entities who have registered under the GST Act. Only GST registered businesses can claim ITC on the tax paid for the purchase of any business relevant inputs.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Who cannot claim ITC?</h3>
                    Input Tax Credit can be claimed only for business purposes. It is not available for goods or services exclusively used for:

                            GST, or Goods and Services Tax, has been one of the biggest tax reforms this country has seen. It is a single tax with which those taxes that existed previously have been replaced. Such as Central Excise, VAT, Entry Tax, Octroi, Service Tax, etc.
                        <br><br>
                        GST was rolled out nationwide on July 1, 2017.
                        <br><br>
                        It is a destination-based tax.
                        <br><br>
                        And follows a dual model in which both the State and the Central government levy tax on goods and services.
                        All businesses are required to obtain a GST number for every state that specific business has been registered in. The first step under the GST regime is to know whether the business is liable to register and register accordingly.

                            When the beneficiary settles the Government obligation rather than the provider. Usually, because the supplier is selling goods, the tax is levied upon the supplier. However, in certain cases, the tax is levied upon the buyer. And the buyer pays GST directly to the government. This is called a reverse charge. Under this, the responsibility to pay tax gets reversed.
                        <br><br>
                        The applicability of RCM is when the supplier is not registered with GST and is making a supply to a GST registered taxpayer. In such a situation, the registered taxpayer is required to remit the applicable GST as a reverse charge to the government.
                        The government has also notified a list on which the reverse charge will be applicable.

                            The GST compliance rating is a rating based on performance & compliance. It is given to all registered taxpayers. The taxpayer is rated based on his adherence to the GST provisions. The rating system is devised on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the type of business. Here, 10 is the most compliant and 1 being the least compliant. Your buyer would prefer to work with as seller with the highest rating.

                            In India, Dual GST has been implemented. That means both the Centre and State governments levy it, simultaneously, on a common tax base. The entities providing an intra-state supply of goods and/or services are to apply GST under the Central GST by the Centre. And the businesses operating within one state are to pay SGST (or the State GST). And the Integrated GST (or the IGST) is being levied and administered by the Centre on every inter-state supply of goods and services.

                            If an entity operates from more than one state, then a separate GST registration is required for each state. For example, a sweet vendor sells in U.P. and Delhi. He needs to have dual GST registration in U.P. and Delhi, respectively. A business with multiple business verticals in a state may obtain a separate registration for each vertical.

                            GST return is a document containing details of income which a taxpayer is required to file with the GST authorities. This helps tax authorities calculate tax liability.

Still, a credit of input tax credit will be available and the same is available as a refund to them. They can either pay tax on the output and claim a refund of IGST or export under Bond without paying IGST and claim a refund of Input Tax Credit (ITC).
