        <h3>GST Audit</h3><br>
        <p>
            The GST law requires audit of the monthly compliances by way of an audit attached to the Annual Return. An annual return must be filed once in a year by the registered taxpayers under GST on the due date as prescribed under law. It is critical for the taxpayers to start focusing on the audit of compliances under GST law and input and output reconciliations form a critical part of the GST audit certification. Annual audit under GST comprises  furnishing a statement in Form 9C, duly certified by a CA/CWA. A registered person whose annual turnover exceeds INR 5 crores (INR 50 million) during the financial year, needs to file a statement of reconciliation between the annual returns in GSTR-9 and the figures mentioned in the audited financial statements in Form-9C. We offer qualitative value – added services encompassing a comprehensive review of all GST records.

Our Stock Audit team follows a strict audit and reporting mechanism that strives for best and makes sure that each minute aspect of stocks is evaluated, and findings are reported in a transparent manner to levels concerned.
